**MFF (Mini Four Feeder)**  
Compact Multi Material System for Klipper

**Announcement Repository – Closed Beta Phase**

The **MFF (Mini Four Feeder)** is an upcoming compact multi-material
filament system **based on the Voron M4 extruder design**.

This repository currently serves as a **public information and announcement
page only**.  
No design files, firmware or configuration files are published here at this time.

## 🔹 Project Overview

### MFF is designed as a compact and modular multi-material solution with a strong focus on:
- Reliability
- Serviceability
- Tight Klipper integration

### Key concepts:
- Based on the **Voron M4 extruder**
- 4 filament lines in a single linear assembly
- One shared drive motor
- Electronic clutch selection per filament line
- Designed for **Klipper** and **Happy Hare**
- Optimized for Voron and custom printer builds

---

## 🔹 Project Status

**Closed Beta Preparation**
- Mechanical design: feature complete, refinement ongoing
- Electronics: prototype hardware validated
- Firmware & macros: functional and under active testing

The project is now entering a closed beta testing phase.

Development continues in private repositories while feedback from selected testers is collected.

---

## 🔹 Closed Beta Test

The closed beta is intended to validate:
- Mechanical reliability
- Clutch behavior and wear
- Firmware logic and macros
- Installation flow and documentation clarity

### Who can apply?
We are looking for experienced users who:
- Are familiar with Klipper-based printers
- Have experience with Voron or custom builds
- Are comfortable testing early hardware and firmware
- Are willing to provide structured feedback

Beta access is limited and by invitation only.
